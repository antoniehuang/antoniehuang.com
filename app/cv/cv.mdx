# *Education*
## University of Birmingham
### BSc Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science - `Sep 2020 - Jun 2022`

Grade: First Class Honours

- Final Year Project: Semi‑Supervised Learning with Pseudo‑labelling and Synthetic Samples. Where I investigated the effectiveness of using synthetic samples generated from a Generative Adversarial Network and pseudo‑labelling technique for the task of improving image classification accuracy on the CIFAR‑10 dataset.

- Led a team project on semantic segmentation on cardiovascular MR images with a custom U‑Net architecture. Achieved Dice coefficient of 0.8.

- Robot Supermarket Assistance, a group project where we designed and implemented a robot with ROS, that would build a map of the supermarket using SLAM and QR code to locate grocery aisles and traverse to the given aisle.

## University of Zurich
### Summer School - Deep Dive in Blockchain

- Final group project where we established a non fungible sharing economy token. Covered the business model, implementation and legal challenges. I was responsible for developing the Ethereum NFT (ERC-721) contract for the token.

- 3 week course covering the technical, economic and legal aspect of Blockchain technology. Delivered by both academics at UZH and industry members.

# *Other*
### Birmingham Environment for Academic Research (BEAR) Challenge 2022

Placed 1st out of 7 teams.

- Challenges involve utilising the Baskerville Tier 2 HPC system to speed up the data engineering pipeline with Dask dataframe, and deep learning
training with multiple GPUs using Horovod.

- Designed an energy/cost‑efficient HPC cluster with 15 server racks, where our design was the most efficient.
